# Laravel User

It's so boring for us - as a developer - to create user module repeatedly in each system we create. That's why I created this package to save more time and effort.

## Installation

```bash
composer require mgamal/laravel-user
```

## Features:
  - List, Create, Update, Show, Delete User
  - Block User
  - User Activities Logs
  - User Subscriptions
  - Filter User
  - Search User

and much more will come!


## Usage

Will be added soon!

## Testing
```bash
composer test
```
